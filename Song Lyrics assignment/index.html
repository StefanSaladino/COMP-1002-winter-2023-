            <!-- artist name-->
        <h3>[Verse one]</h3>
        <!-- all h3's on this page are sub-subheadings-->    
        <p>Feeling my way through the darkness</p>
        <!-- separating each line with a paragraph break for formatting purposes-->
        <p>Guided by a beating heart</p>

        <p>I can't tell where the journey will end</p>

        <p>But I know where to start</p>

        <p>They tell me I'm too young to understand</p>

        <p>They say I'm caught up in a dream</p>

        <p>Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes</p>

        <p>Well that's fine by me

        </p>
        <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
        <p>

        <p>So wake me up when it's all over</p>

        <p>When I'm wiser and I'm older</p>

        <p>All this time I was finding myself</p>

        <p>And I didn't know I was lost</p>

        <p>So wake me up when it's all over</p>

        <p>When I'm wiser and I'm older</p>

        <p>All this time I was finding myself</p>

        <p>And I didn't know I was lost  

        </p>

        <h3>[Verse Two]</h3>
        <p>I tried carrying the weight of the world</p>

        <p>But I only have two hands</p>

        <p>I hope I get the chance to travel the world</p>

        <p>But I don't have any plans</p>

        <p>Wish that I could stay forever this young</p>

        <p>Not afraid to close my eyes</p>

        <p>Life's a game made for everyone</p>

        <p>love is the prize

        </p>

        <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
        <p>So wake me up when it's all over</p>

        <p>When I'm wiser and I'm older</p>

        <p>All this time I was finding myself</p>

        <p>And I didn't know I was lost</p>

        <p>So wake me up when it's all over</p>

        <p>When I'm wiser and I'm older</p>

        <p>All this time I was finding myself</p>

        <p>And I didn't know I was lost

        <h3>[Bridge]</h3>
        <p>I didn't know I was lost</p>

        <p>I didn't know I was lost</p>

        <p>I didn't know I was lost</p>

        <p>I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know
