                        For years many have thought that Lite Brite faded into obscurity. We are here to
                        prove that this is factually incorrect. We're back and better than ever! Shout it
                        from the rooftops! Tell your friends (or your pet if you don't have any friends)!

                        Lite Brite is a toy created by Hasbro in 1967. The concept behind the toy was simple:
                        it consisted of a flat panel with small holes where kids could insert translucent plastic
                        pegs. When the panel was turned on, it would illuminate the pegs, creating a colorful and
                        glowing design.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lite Brite quickly became a popular toy among children and even adults,
                        as it allowed for endless creativity and imagination. The original Lite Brite was
                        designed with a black paper background, but Hasbro later released different versions
                        with different backgrounds, such as white, pink, and even special licensed backgrounds
                        featuring popular characters like Spider-Man and Scooby-Doo.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Over the years, Lite Brite has gone through several updates and iterations, including a
                        flat-screen version and a travel-sized version. Despite the changes, the toy has remained
                        a popular classic, and its colorful designs continue to inspire creativity and nostalgia in
                        generations of kids and adults alike.
